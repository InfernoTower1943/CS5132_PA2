For registering for modules, various parameters would need to be considered in order to decide who gets accepted into modules. Preferences of individuals, the required registration of some core modules and others. Hence, we created an app to help facilitate this registration using the PriorityQueue class.

There are 3 layouts on this app. Login, Admin and Student.

In Login, you can enter a username and password to enter as either an admin or student.

As a student, you can pick from the various modules. Some of them are required for certain student accounts. You can also pick your preferences for the timeslots of the modules and it would be recorded in a priorityQueue for that specific timeslot.

As an admin, you can change the requirements of students, view the preference and priority queue and dequeue students from the priority queue of each module.
